# DSE511 Homework 2 GitHub Repo

This homework assignment deals with working with GitHub. The three parts of the assignment can 
be seen below:
+ Comprehension (10% total)
+ Basic Commands (40% total)
+ GitHub (50% total)


This ReadME.md, and the GitHub repo that it lives in are primarily for the homework section GitHub.
The GitHub section is broken into 4 questions:
1. (10%) Create a GitHub repo on your account titled ***dse11_homework***. It should ***not** be private.
If it is private, you get a 0 for this entire section. ***DO NOT MAKE IT PRIVATE***.
2. (15%) Add a readme.
   + The readme file should be at the root directory of the repo, and be named README.md. You can create it locally (use whatever text editor you want) or you can create it on GitHub
     (careful with primary branch naming if you do!)
   + Add some basic markdown-formatted text explaining what the repo is.
   + Commit the readme to your primary branch (and if working locally, push it to GitHub).
3. (15%) Create a feature branch
   1. Branch off your primary branch (this should include the readme). Call the feature branch ***new-feature***
   2. Add a file called ***new_feature*** that contains some text (you choose), and commit this to your feature branch
   3. Push your feature branch to GitHub
4. (10%) Create (***BUT DO NOT MERGE***) a PR from the feature branch of your repo into the primary branch of your repo.


As a note we can delete this repo after the assigment is graded.
